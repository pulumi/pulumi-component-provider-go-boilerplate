# xyz Pulumi Component Provider (Go)

This repo is a boilerplate showing how to create a Pulumi component provider written in Go. You can search-replace `xyz` with the name of your desired provider as a starting point for creating a component provider for your component resources.

An example `StaticPage` [component resource](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/concepts/resources/#components) is available in `provider/pkg/provider/staticPage.go`. This component creates a static web page hosted in an AWS S3 Bucket. There is nothing special about `StaticPage` -- it is a typical component resource written in Go.

The component provider makes component resources available to other languages. The implementation is in `provider/pkg/provider/provider.go`. Each component resource in the provider must have an implementation in the `Construct` function to create an instance of the requested component resource and return its `URN` and state (outputs). There is an initial implementation that demonstrates an implementation of `Construct` for the example `StaticPage` component.

A code generator is available which generates SDKs in TypeScript, Python, Go and .NET which are also checked in to the `sdk` folder. The SDKs are generated from a schema in `schema.json`. This file should be kept aligned with the component resources supported by the component provider implementation.

An example of using the `StaticPage` component in TypeScript is in `examples/simple`.

Note that the generated provider plugin (`pulumi-resource-xyz`) must be on your `PATH` to be used by Pulumi deployments. If creating a provider for distribution to other users, you should ensure they install this plugin to their `PATH`.

> Note: Authoring a component provider is currently fairly "low-level" and involves a number of manual steps.  Over the coming weeks and months, we will be improving the authoring and publishing experience in several dimensions.  If you are implementing Pulumi components using this provider, please do share feedback at https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/issues/new or on the [Pulumi Community Slack](https://slack.pulumi.com).

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.15
- Pulumi CLI
- Node.js (to build the Node.js SDK)
- Yarn (to build the Node.js SDK)
- Python 3.6+ (to build the Python SDK)
- .NET Core SDK (to build the .NET SDK)

## Build and Test

```bash
# Build and install the provider (plugin copied to ./bin)
make install_provider

# Add ./bin to PATH
export PATH=$(pwd)/bin:$PATH

# Regenerate SDKs
make generate

# Test Node.js SDK
$ make install_nodejs_sdk
$ cd examples/simple
$ yarn install
$ yarn link @pulumi/xyz
$ pulumi stack init test
$ pulumi config set aws:region us-east-1
$ pulumi up
```

## Naming

The `xyz` provider's plugin binary must be named `pulumi-resource-xyz` (in the format `pulumi-resource-<provider>`).

While the provider plugin must follow this naming convention, the SDK package naming can be customized. TODO explain.

## Example component

Let's look at the example `StaticPage` component resource in more detail.

### Schema

The example `StaticPage` component resource is defined in `schema.json`:

```json
"resources": {
    "xyz:index:StaticPage": {
        "isComponent": true,
        "inputProperties": {
            "indexContent": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The HTML content for index.html."
            }
        },
        "requiredInputs": [
            "indexContent"
        ],
        "properties": {
            "bucket": {
                "$ref": "/aws/v3.30.0/schema.json#/resources/aws:s3%2Fbucket:Bucket",
                "description": "The bucket resource."
            },
            "websiteUrl": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The website URL."
            }
        },
        "required": [
            "bucket",
            "websiteUrl"
        ]
    }
}
```

The component resource's type token is `xyz:index:StaticPage` in the format of `<package>:<module>:<type>`. In this case, it's in the `xyz` package and `index` module. This is the same type token passed to `RegisterComponentResource` inside the implementation of `NewStaticPage` in `provider/pkg/provider/staticPage.go`, and also the same token referenced in `Construct` in `provider/pkg/provider/provider.go`.

This component has a required `indexContent` input property typed as `string`, and two required output properties: `bucket` and `websiteUrl`. Note that `bucket` is typed as the `aws:s3/bucket:Bucket` resource from the `aws` provider (in the schema the `/` is escaped as `%2F`).

Since this component returns a type from the `aws` provider, each SDK must reference the associated Pulumi `aws` SDK for the language. For the .NET, Node.js, and Python SDKs, dependencies are specified in the `language` section of the schema:

```json
"language": {
    "csharp": {
        "packageReferences": {
            "Pulumi": "2.*",
            "Pulumi.Aws": "3.*"
        }
    },
    "nodejs": {
        "dependencies": {
            "@pulumi/aws": "^3.30.0"
        },
        "devDependencies": {
            "typescript": "^3.7.0"
        }
    },
    "python": {
        "requires": {
            "pulumi": ">=2.21.2,<3.0.0",
            "pulumi-aws": ">=3.30.0,<4.0.0"
        }
    }
}
```

For the Go SDK, dependencies are specified in the `sdk/go.mod` file.

### Implementation

The implementation of this component is in `provider/pkg/provider/staticPage.go` and the structure of the component's inputs and outputs aligns with what is defined in `schema.json`:

```go
// The set of arguments for creating a StaticPage component resource.
type StaticPageArgs struct {
	IndexContent pulumi.StringInput `pulumi:"indexContent"`
}

// The StaticPage component resource.
type StaticPage struct {
	pulumi.ResourceState

	Bucket     *s3.Bucket          `pulumi:"bucket"`
	WebsiteUrl pulumi.StringOutput `pulumi:"websiteUrl"`
}

// NewStaticPage creates a new StaticPage component resource.
func NewStaticPage(ctx *pulumi.Context, name string, args *StaticPageArgs, opts ...pulumi.ResourceOption) (*StaticPage, error) {
    ...
}
```

All inputs to a component should be `Input`s, as callers from any language are allowed to pass `Output` values to any input property - which may be unknown during previews, or may be secret values during previews or updates.

The provider makes this component resource available in the `Construct` function in `provider/pkg/provider/provider.go`. When `Construct` is called and the `typ` argument is `xyz:index:StaticPage`, we create an instance of the `StaticPage` component resource and return its `URN` and outputs as its state.


```go
func constructStaticPage(ctx *pulumi.Context, name string, inputs *pulumi.ConstructInputs,
	options pulumi.ResourceOption) (pulumi.ConstructResult, error) {

	// Copy the raw inputs to StaticPageArgs. `inputs.SetArgs` uses the types and `pulumi:` tags
	// on the struct's fields to convert the raw values to the appropriate Input types.
	args := &StaticPageArgs{}
	if err := inputs.SetArgs(args); err != nil {
		return pulumi.ConstructResult{}, errors.Wrap(err, "setting args")
	}

	// Create the component resource.
	staticPage, err := NewStaticPage(ctx, name, args, options)
	if err != nil {
		return pulumi.ConstructResult{}, errors.Wrap(err, "creating component")
	}

	// Return the component resource's URN and outputs as its state.
	return pulumi.ConstructResult{
		URN: staticPage.URN(),
		State: pulumi.Map{
			"bucket":     staticPage.Bucket,
			"websiteUrl": staticPage.WebsiteUrl,
		},
	}, nil
}
```

## Publishing

To share your provider with others, you will distribute the SDKs for each language, as well as the provider binary. 

To publish the SDKs, build them and then use the corresponding package manager tools for each language.

```bash
### Build the Node.JS SDK into an NPM package in sdk/nodejs/bin.  You can then `npm publish` the resulting package.
make build_nodejs_sdk

### Build the .NET SDK into a NuGet package in sdk/dotnet/bin/Debug/.  You can then `dotnet nuget push` the resulting package.
make build_dotnet_sdk

### Build the Python SDK into a Python package in sdk/python/bin/dist.  You can then `twine upload` the resulting package.
make build_python_sdk

### For Go, you do not need to build a package.  The SDK will be referenced directly from this GitHub repository at
### ```go
### import "github.com/pulumi/pulumi-xyz/sdk/xyz"
### ```
```

The plugin binary is built to `./bin/pulumi-resource-xyz` and users must arrange for it to be on their `PATH` prior to running Pulumi programs using the component.

## Troubleshooting

### `error: no resource plugin 'xyz-v0.0.1' found in the workspace or on your $PATH, install the plugin using `pulumi plugin install resource xyz v0.0.1`

Make sure you have `./bin` added to your `PATH`.  The `pulumi-resource-xyz` provider binary will be built there, and must be available on `PATH`.
